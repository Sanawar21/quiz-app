# quiz-app

A quiz app that is connected with a firebase database. 

The app supports comments, likes and followers and followings for each user and advanced user authentication.

It can be ran on android, ios, windows, and as a web app on chrome.

The app is by no means perfect. It was done as a practice while I was still very new to flutter and had a weeks worth of knowledge so it has a lot of aspects that could be 
done 1000 times better.

I wish to revisit this app once I learn more about flutter and the firebase database and optimize this in several areas.
